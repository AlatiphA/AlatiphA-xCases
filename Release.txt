Version 1.1.0 – GitHub Migration Update
I'm looking for new ways to improve on this add-in. This time around:
  - Moved all versioning, release notes, and update files from Google Drive to GitHub.
  - Version.txt and Release.txt now served via GitHub raw URLs.
  - Added SHA-256 hash verification for downloaded update files.
  - Automatic add-in download and install now uses GitHub Releases.
  - Improved Get Local Version reliability.
